# Project Title

Brief description of your project.

## Installation and Usage

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: First, install the project dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Usage**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project by running:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This command will start the server, and your project will be accessible at the specified port (if any).

3. **API Documentation**: The API documentation is available at `http://localhost:<port>/api-docs`, where `<port>` is the port on which your server is running. You can use this URL to explore and interact with the API endpoints using Swagger UI.
